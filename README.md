# View Flow for Android

ViewFlow is an Android UI widget providing a horizontally scrollable [ViewGroup](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.html) with items populated from an [Adapter](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Adapter.html). Scroll down to the bottom of the page for a screen shot.

The component is a [Library Project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject). This means that there's no need to copy-paste resources into your own project, simply add the viewflow component as a reference to any project.

## Usage

### In your layout

    <org.taptwo.android.widget.ViewFlow
	    android:id="@+id/viewflow"
	    app:sidebuffer="5"
        />

The use of `app:sidebuffer` is optional. It defines the number of Views to buffer on each side of the currently shown View. The default sidebuffer is 3, making up a grand total of 7 (3 * 2 + 1) Views loaded at a time (at max).
To be able to use the more convenient `app:title` the application namespace must be included in the same manner as the android namespace is. Please refer to the layout main.xml in the example project for a full example. Again, note that it's the application namespace and *not* the viewflow namespace that must be referred like `xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/your.application.package.here"`.

### In your activity

    ViewFlow viewFlow = (ViewFlow) findViewById(R.id.viewflow);
    viewFlow.setAdapter(myAdapter);

### Listen on screen change events

If you need to listen to screen change events you would want to implement your own `ViewFlow.ViewSwitchListener` and pass it to the `setOnViewSwitchListener()` method.

    viewFlow.setOnViewSwitchListener(new ViewSwitchListener() {
        public void onSwitched(View v, int position) {
            // Your code here
        }
    });

### Flow Indicator
It is also possible to add a flow view indicator to your layout. The purpose of a `FlowIndicator` is to present a visual representation of where in the item list focus is at. You may either implement a `FlowIndicator` yourself or use an implementation provided by the View Flow library. The View Flow library currently supports the following indicators:

#### Circle Flow Indicator ####
This indicator shows a circle for each `View` in the adapter with a filled circle for the currently selected view (see screenshot below).

	<org.taptwo.android.widget.CircleFlowIndicator
		android:padding="10dip" android:layout_height="wrap_content"
		android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:id="@+id/viewflowindic"
		android:background="#00000000"/>

And then you'll need to connect your `ViewFlow` with the `FlowIndicator`:

	CircleFlowIndicator indic = (CircleFlowIndicator) findViewById(R.id.viewflowindic);
	viewFlow.setFlowIndicator(indic);

#### Title Flow Indicator ####
This indicator presents the title of the previous, current and next `View` in the adapter (see screenshot below).

		<org.taptwo.android.widget.TitleFlowIndicator
			android:id="@+id/viewflowindic" android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:layout_width="fill_parent"
			app:footerLineHeight="2"
			app:footerTriangleHeight="10" app:textColor="#FFFFFFFF" app:selectedColor="#FFFFC445"
			app:footerColor="#FFFFC445" app:titlePadding="10" app:textSize="13" 
			android:layout_marginTop="10dip" />

And then you'll need to connect your `ViewFlow` with the `FlowIndicator`:

		TitleFlowIndicator indicator = (TitleFlowIndicator) findViewById(R.id.viewflowindic);
		indicator.setTitleProvider(myTitleProvider);
		viewFlow.setFlowIndicator(indicator);

GitHub has some great articles on [how to get started with Git and GitHub](http://help.github.com/) and how to [fork a project](http://help.github.com/forking/).

Contributers are recommended to fork the app on GitHub (but don't have too). Create a feature branch, push the branch to git hub, press Pull Request and write a simple explanation.

One fix per commit. If say a a commit closes the open issue 12. Just add `closes #12` in your commit message to close that issue automagically.

If you still feel uncomfortable contributing the project github-wise, don't hesistate to send a regular patch.
